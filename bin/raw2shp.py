#Purpose:
#Convert raw results from the Holy Hand Grenade
#to a shapefile of crater circles (polygons)
#This is using the buffer option from OGR
#The first line has the center point location
#The second line has one point from the crater ring
#The buffer distance is thus the Euclidian distance from both points
