# HHG
HHG - Crater survey tool for crater counting

# Rationale behing the name of the project

Crater counting is a method for estimating the age of a planet's surface. The method is based upon the assumptions that a new surface forms with zero impact craters, and that impact craters accumulate at some constant rate. The method has been calibrated using the ages of samples returned from the Moon [1]_, and then used on several planetary surfaces.

Crater counting thus represent an important base for reconstruct the geologic evolution of a planetary surface, and to support this or that theory.  

Thus the Monty Python's [Holy Hand Granade sketch |https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOrgLj9lOwk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOrgLj9lOwk) seemed the perfect name for the project, ideed.
